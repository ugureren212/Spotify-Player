# Spotify-App
A music player using the Spotify API. Also displays lyrics of the track.

To run the application use "npm start" in the terminal within the "/spotify-player" directory.

To run the nodejs server use "nodemon server" in the terminal within the "/server" directory.

The server must be ran along side the react application as the Spotify API access key requires a server.
